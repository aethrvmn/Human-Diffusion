# Prehistoric Human Dispersion
## The Exodus from Africa

This is a Qlearning project for the course Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Torino.

In this repo you will find the LaTeX for the project, as well as the .ipynb that I used to simulate the prehistoric migrations of anatomically modern humans out of Africa, towards two of the three major points of migration, namely Australia and East Siberia (from where humans are understood to have colonised the American Continent).

Below is a simple explanation of the Qlearning algorithm that I drew, which I unfortunately couldn't use in the LaTeX due to space constraints.

For any more information, the code is in the .ipynb file.
